# GAN-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

GAN to generate fake handwritten digits
This GAN uses MNIST dataset to build generator and discriminator networks to create fake handwritten digits from original data

Building both generator and discriminator models using sequential like CNN
Generating noise(synthetic) images using generator and concatenating it with original images

Train discriminator on the o/p of generative model and classify noise and original
